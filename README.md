# A bunch of VS Code things
Never miss the opportunity when someone leaves their computer unlocked. Especially if their VS Code is open.

## VS Code not dark enough?
Feel like the theme isn't dark(or bright) enough that even the text colours themselves need to be changed? Never fear because with a simple ctrl+c and ctrl+v, you can change that in no time!

1) Open the folder "VS Code Colour Nuke" and decide how much you need to nuke their colour scheme.

> - Black-Theme.txt
    Will only change the colours in the editor. 
> - Black-Theme-Complete.txt
    Their entire VS Code turns black. Their editor, tabs, everything.
1) Open settings.json 
    >Ctrl+Shift+P to search settings.json
2) Copy and paste the text in "Black-Theme.txt" into it
>"Black-theme-complete.txt" is also fine if you want to nuke literally all the colours.
3) Watch your friend's face turn as dark as the theme when they return to their screen
> Want to brighten someone's day instead? Simply replace #1e1e1e with #ffffff :)
