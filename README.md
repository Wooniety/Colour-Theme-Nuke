# VS Code Colour Nuke

## Black is the new black

Found a candidate for Donut Lord or simply think that all those _'dark themes'_ just don't cut it? Well here's your extension to just nuke all the colours!

Note: Currently, extension only changes colours in the editor. Follow steps below and use [black-theme-complete](text/Black-theme-complete.txt)

## Too dark?

Change it up with the files in the text folder!

1) Open settings.json
    > Ctrl+Shift+P to search settings.json
2) Copy and paste the any of the files in the [text](text) folder into it
3) Replace `#1e1e1e` with the colour of your choice
