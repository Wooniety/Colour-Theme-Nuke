# A bunch of VS Code things
Never miss the opportunity when someone leaves their computer unlocked. Especially if their VS Code is open. (More to be added I hope) 

## VS Code not dark enough?
1) Open settings.json 
    Ctrl+Shift+P to search settings.json
2) Copy and paste the text in "Black-Theme.json" into it
> Want to brighten someone's day instead? Simply replace #000000 with #ffffff :)
3) Watch your friend's face turn as dark as the theme when they return to their screen
